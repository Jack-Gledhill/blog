# Welcome to The Unfiltered Blog!

Hello all! This is my blog, where I talk about random stuff that I find interesting.
Topics may (or may not) include:

- Tech
- Games
- TTRPGs
- Tutorials
- Literally anything else I can use to procrastinate

<!-- more -->

For now, I'm calling this little crevice of the internet The Unfiltered Blog. 
I'm sure someone, somewhere has already laid claim to that name, but such is the nature of the internet.

## Building The Unfiltered Blog

I built this blog using [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). It's a piece of software I'm very familiar with and have used a number of times (most recently for [NoDDSoc's website](https://jackgledhill.com/about/noddsoc.co.uk)).

While I could've cooked up something to hook directly into my [portfolio](https://jackgledhill.com), I decided to keep things separate. 
Not only did this let me give the blog its own identity, but it meant I could take advantage of a lot of Material's features that would've taken a lot of time to implement myself.
Those features include:

- Search functionality
- A comments system (courtesy of [Giscus](https://giscus.app))
- Google Analytics integration
- Automatic indexing and archiving
- Tags and categories
- An RSS feed
- Social cards, which you can see when this blog is shared on social media

## Using the Blog

Most of the blog is pretty intuitive to use, but there are a few niche things that might need a bit of explaining.

### Commenting

Users can comment on posts using the integrated Giscus comments system.
This uses the blog's [GitHub repository Discussion board](https://github.com/Jack-Gledhill/blog/discussions) as a backend, so you'll need a GitHub account to be able to comment.
Feel free to use this to ask questions, give feedback, or chat about the post in general.

!!! warning
    Please be a decent human being when commenting, I don't have time to deal with bigots.

### RSS Feed

RSS is a standardised protocol that allows users to subscribe to a feed of content.
You'll need an RSS reader app or browser extension to use it. 
Once you have one set up, you can subscribe to all sorts of feeds, including blogs, news sites and some podcasts.

The RSS feed for this blog is available [here](/feed_rss_created.xml). You can also get this feed in JSON format [here](/feed_json_created.json).

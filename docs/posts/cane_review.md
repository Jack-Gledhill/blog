# The Stick 2, Electric Boogaloo: A Review of My New Cane

I recently purchased a brand-new cane, and was asked to share my experience with it so far...

<!-- more -->

!!! note
    While this post was primarily written as a joke for my friends, everything I say here is my honest opinion.

## Why I use a cane

Those who know me well will know I have a currently-unknown condition that causes weakness, fatigue and pain in my legs.
I've been using a cane every day for over a year now as my condition has worsened, so I think I'm well-qualified to pass judgement by this point.

## The Predecessor

Prior to buying the new cane, I've been using [this cane](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B3QT8HZ2) (known colloquially as "The Stick", "The Stick of Inclusion" and "a blunt-force weapon").
I purchased this back in May 2024, and have used it until July 2025. It's a foldable cane with a fritz handle - a solid choice for a first cane.

The Stick has served me well, but had a few minor issues that drove me to look for a replacement. 
Namely, The Stick was very clicky when walking, which was both annoying and brought unwanted attention (especially on hard surfaces).
Additionally, the handle became uncomfortable to hold after long periods of use, and the rubber tip was worn down to the point where the end of The Stick had poked through completely (making it even louder).
It was also slightly too short, even at its maximum height, which made it uncomfortable to use a lot of the time.
And finally, I had dented the aluminium shaft early on, meaning the end was curved slightly, which made it harder to use on uneven surfaces.

## The Successor

At some point in the past few months, I realised it was time for a âœ¨ Cane Glow Up ðŸ’…. I began looking for something that would address the issues I had with The Stick, while also being stylish af.

After a couple of weeks of searching and thinking, I decided to purchase [this bad boy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09BD2MV9T) (henceforth known as "The Stick 2").
The Stick 2 is a foldable cane with a much bigger rubber tip, a more comfortable handle and a cool carbon fibre design.

Its derby handle is a lot more comfortable than the previous cane's fritz handle. The best part is that it is completely silent: no clicking, no impact noise, nothing!
Overall, I'm quite impressed with it. Only time will tell how well it holds up, but so far it seems to be a solid upgrade.

## What now?

The Stick has reached its retirement. I'll probably keep it around in case I ever need a backup, but I don't plan on using it again.

For now, I'll be rocking The Stick 2 as my daily cane of choice.

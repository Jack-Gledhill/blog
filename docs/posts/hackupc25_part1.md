# HackUPC 2025 Part 1: The Tourist

A plastic cow, a bitcoin ATM(?), and a driverless train.

<!-- more -->

!!! info
    For the reader's sanity, this post has been split into two parts.

    - Part 1 discusses the journey to Barcelona and our time there before the Hackathon
    - [Part 2](/2025/07/23/hackupc-2025-part-2-the-hacker) discusses the hackathon itself, including the challenges we faced and the projects we built

On the adventure with me were my friends Euan, Harry and Adam.
We're all CompSci students at Sheffield and have been friends since our first year.

## The Prosanta to Barcelona Pipeline

We flew from Manchester Airport on Wednesday afternoon, after taking a train from Sheffield to Manchester Piccadilly, then onto Manchester Airport. 
We had started our day together in a Devices and Networks lab run by the legendary [Dr Prosanta Gope](https://sites.google.com/view/prosantagope). 
Greatly amused by this, we decided to dub the journey "the Prosanta to Barcelona Pipeline". 

### Manchester Airport

At the airport, we decided to kill some time with a bit of plane-spotting.
We trecked up to the Manchester Airport car park; one of the best spots to watch planes take off and land.

### The Driverless Metro

Once we landed in BCN, we wandered aimlessly for a bit until we found our way to the airport metro station.
From there we took the L9 Sud line to Maria Cristina, a short walk from [our hotel](https://arenas.atiramhotels.com/en/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20343383959&gbraid=0AAAAADj9yVI_RiX4reryaJ87T9Xha0qI6&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhO3DBhDkARIsANxrhTrdyFaTmCv5nQ3iq3AI8iN2MEviZvYJHzl_yg81MtK8129a1gz7nn4aAh4DEALw_wcB).

It wasn't until the journey back that we realised the L9 line is completely driverless.
The line is completely automated from start to finish, with no human conductor or driver at all.
In fact, there wasn't even a cab at the front of the train, just glass for passengers to look through at the underground tunnels.

We managed to film a timelapse of the train as it took us from one station to the next.

Driverless vehicles aren't very common in the UK, even the London Underground has a driver in the cab of every train[^1], and there are still no plans to introduce them[^2].

## Two Days in Barcelona

### Wednesday Evening

After dumping our bags at the hotel, we decided to spend the rest of our evening exploring the city and tasting the cuisine.
We wandered around for a few hours, observing the restaurants on offer, before finally settling down at a place called [El Racó](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187497-d781355-Reviews-El_Raco_Rambla_Catalunya-Barcelona_Catalonia.html) in Rambla de Catalunya.
There, we enjoyed some freshly made calzones and a Fanta Lemon (which we had developed a dependency for by the end of the trip).
As expected, the food was delicious, and the Fanta Lemon addicting.

We later decided we wanted some dessert, so we went to a nearby ice cream shop that sold the most delicious ice cream I have ever tasted.
Unfortunately, I can't remember the name of the place, but it was within walking distance of El Racó.

### Thursday

Thursday saw a lot of exploration. We headed into the city centre and visited a few of the tourist attractions.

#### The Sagrada Família

First, we visited the [Sagrada Família](https://sagradafamilia.org/en/home), one of the largest Catholic churches in the world, that's been under construction for over 140 years[^3].
Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to go inside - the queues were very long, and we needed to eat soon.

#### A Bitcoin ATM?

While continuing our adventure to find lunch, we stumbled across something that caught our attention: a Bitcoin ATM.
To this day, we're still not entirely sure what it is. It was closed when we found it, so we weren't able to find out.

#### Barceloneta

On the way to find lunch, we took the metro to Drassanes; a station just near the Barceloneta (Barcelona's port).
We strolled along the boardwalk for a while and took in the sights, before touring the nearby shopping centre.
It was here that Adam found an Ale-Hop, a shop that sells an odd variety of products.
Unfortunately, it was extremely hot on the inside, so we didn't hang around much.

We then spent the rest of the afternoon wandering the streets of Barcelona, trying to find a good spot to eat.

### Friday

Thursday had been a very busy day. Needless to say, my legs weren't quite up to doing quite as much on Friday as they had the day before.
Having decided to take it easy, we spent the day visiting cafés and restaurants, while still getting in a few steps.

#### Return of the Ale-Hop

During our relaxed day, we stumbled across another Ale-Hop, this time in the city centre.
This time, the temperature inside was bearable, so we went in and had a good look around.
We came across an interesting variety of products, including a plastic cow that we all needed a photoshoot with.

#### Preparing for the Hackathon

The Hackathon would begin later that evening, so we decided to head back to the hotel a few hours early to prepare.
We had no idea what we were going to build, or what we could expect in terms of challenges, so we wanted to be ready for anything.

You can read about what we did at the hackathon in [Part 2 of this post]().

## The Journey Home

The hackathon ended at 4pm on Sunday, and our flight was at 11pm, so we had plenty of time to kill. 
We'd already checked out of the hotel earlier that day, so we spent some time browsing the restaurants in the area. 
We eventually settled on [Avinyó 10](https://avinyo10.com); a cute restaurant tucked away in the Gothic Quarter. 
Once again, the food was delicious, and the Fanta Lemon was intoxicating.

We then grabbed some ice cream from a nearby shop, and headed for the airport.

### Inflatable Bananas

Once we'd gotten to the airport, we realised our flight had been delayed. At first, by an hour, then by another. 
Our 11pm flight was now scheduled to leave at 1am, which meant we had time to kill. 
Adam decided now was a great time to try out Vueling's banana - an inflatable shaped like a banana and intended for lounging while you wait for a flight. 
Even more entertaining than the banana itself was the inflation method; running around the airport terminal and then quickly sealing it before the air escaped.

### Flying Home

We were exhausted by the time we made it onto the plane, but we were finally heading home. 
The flight was uneventful, save for a sleep-deprived Euan asking if he can open the window on an Airbus A321.

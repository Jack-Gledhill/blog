I purchased this back in May 2024, and have used it until July 2025. It's a foldable cane with a fritz handle - a solid choice for a first cane.</p> <p>The Stick has served me well, but had a few minor issues that drove me to look for a replacement.  Namely, The Stick was very clicky when walking, which was both annoying and brought unwanted attention (especially on hard surfaces). Additionally, the handle became uncomfortable to hold after long periods of use, and the rubber tip was worn down to the point where the end of The Stick had poked through completely (making it even louder). It was also slightly too short, even at its maximum height, which made it uncomfortable to use a lot of the time. And finally, I had dented the aluminium shaft early on, meaning the end was curved slightly, which made it harder to use on uneven surfaces.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1: Damage to The Stick after over a year of use</p>"},{"location":"2025/07/18/the-stick-2-electric-boogaloo-a-review-of-my-new-cane/#the-successor","title":"The Successor","text":"<p>At some point in the past few months, I realised it was time for a \u2728 Cane Glow Up \ud83d\udc85.

The Stick 2 is a foldable cane with a much bigger rubber tip, a more comfortable handle and a cool carbon fibre design.</p> <p>Its derby handle is a lot more comfortable than the previous cane's fritz handle. The best part is that it is completely silent: no clicking, no impact noise, nothing! Overall, I'm quite impressed with it. Only time will tell how well it holds up, but so far it seems to be a solid upgrade.</p>"},{"location":"2025/07/18/the-stick-2-electric-boogaloo-a-review-of-my-new-cane/#what-now","title":"What now?","text":"<p>The Stick has reached its retirement.
